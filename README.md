# WeatherApp

Weather App using JS, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap, Open Weather API

This is the final assignment for the SheCdoes Plus online coding course.

Outside the course I was learning about Crockford's object pattern and that polluting the global name space is Bad, hence I have locked everything up in Immediately-Invoked Function Expressions (IIFEs). I like them for the API like returns and the neat sections however I believe I may have ended up with some degree of Callback Hell. Managable for a program of this size and complexity, but my next step will be to learn how to avoid that.

You may notice that there is no error handling, which is simply because I haven't learnt how to do that yet! If it seems broken, just refresh the page ;)
